            <h3>What is prototype pattern ? </h3>
            <b>Prototype pattern </b> are memory efficient since every public functions and varibales are declared in the prototype
            of the function therefore, whenever instance are created for that function every instance will not have copy
            of those functions and variables which are in prototype. Rather those instances will have reference to the variables
            and functions hence it is memory efficient.
            <h3>When We need it ? </h3>
            When we want to create a class and whose various instances has to be used in many places. For example if we create a Animal
            Class and we can create many concreate animals later.
            <h3>What is disadvantages of prototype pattern</h3>
            <p>
                In
                <b>Module Pattern</b> public function can access private functions. However in
                <b>prototype pattern </b> public function declared in prototype object can not access any private functions
                or variables.
